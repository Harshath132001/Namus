# NamUs Missing Persons Data Scraper

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python-based OSINT automation tool that scrapes publicly available missing persons case listings from the **NamUs (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System)** website.

It was originally developed during my internship at **Paradigm Intelligence** to support research workflows related to missing children investigations.
